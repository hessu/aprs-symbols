Copyright and licensing information
======================================

This is a collection of vectorized symbols for use on the APRS system.

The copyright status of this collection is a bit complicated, since the
symbols come from various sources, each having different copyright owners.

Most of the vectorized symbols are loosely based on the low-resolution
"standard" bitmap symbol set as distributed by Stephen Smith, WA8LMF.  That
set is used by most APRS software around the world.  The low resolution of
those symbols does not allow direct vector conversion, so I've drawn new
symbols in a similar layout.  The vector versions try to mimic the original
appearance and colours, with the intention of keeping the set recognizable
and familiar to existing users.  In some cases the vector versions are
probably similar enough to the originals, so that they cannot be considered
"original work" by myself.  In some of these cases, the originals are
probably also mimicking someone else's design.

The original symbols do not come with any information on their licensing.
They've been distributed with a lot of APRS software over time, but I don't
know who designed which symbol originally. Most likely all of them are
drawn by one of:

  * Roger Barker, G4IDE, "original set provided with UI-View" (SK)
  * Steve Dimse, KH4G, "U.S. customary set"
  * Stephen Smith, WA8LMF

The Adobe Illustrator (.ai) file contains a copy of the original bitmaps
as a hidden layer, just for reference.

Some symbols I obtained from other sources, such as Wikipedia. In those
cases I picked SVG versions which allow commercial reuse (source known, and
the work is placed on public domain, or with a CC license which allows
adaptation and commercial reuse).

Some symbols are vectorized versions of product or brand logos. The
copyright of those is owned by the respective companies (Apple, Microsoft,
Kenwood), and each of those may have some opinions on how the logos are
used.  Please check for yourself if you can use them or not.

In the list below I try to summarize the licensing status for each symbol.


Shorthand notation for common licensing status
-------------------------------------------------

* *VEC-OH7LZB* - Vectorized by OH7LZB, based on original APRS symbol set
  * Source of original bitmap: http://wa8lmf.net/aprs/APRS_symbols.htm
  * Original designer of individual symbol unknown at this time, but one of:
    * Roger Barker, G4IDE
    * Steve Dimse, KH4G
    * Stephen Smith, WA8LMF
  * Vectorized versions are designed to look similar
  * Licensing: Unknown
* *OH7LZB* - Original vector design by Heikki Hannikainen, OH7LZB
  * Different enough (by author's opinion) to make it a new original work,
    instead of a copy of the old symbol
